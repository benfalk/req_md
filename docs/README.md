Welcome to the `ReqMd` documentation! These docs are aimed at explaining the
format specification, tools available, and structure of the codebase. The menu
navigation can take you to these different topics.  I hope you find the
information you're looking for, but, if you don't please feel free to [post in
the discussions] on Github with your question.

## Inspiration

While pair-programming in 2019 a colleague demonstrated [this fantastic VS Code
plugin] which parsed HTTP requests in a special file format. These requests could
be sent and the results displayed back directly from the editor.  I have always
been a staunch user of Vim and Neovim so I set out looking for a similar plugin
for my editor of choice with minimal luck.  As I was learning Rust back then I
decided to cut my teeth on building a similar tool and `req_md` was born.  My
appreciation for markdown's simplicity and extendibility is why I opted to use
it as the host format.
