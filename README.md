# Request MD

This originally was a project that converted Markdown files to HTTP
requests, but has since evolved into a more comprehensive tool for
managing, creating, and executing HTTP requests using the markdown
syntax.

The original project can be found at `crates/req_md` for now while
the rest of the project is being developed.
